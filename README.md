# Assignment Information Studies for the  University of Amsterdam

All applicants for the Data Science track can check their programming experience and statistical background before they apply by making this assignment. The assignment is a good representation of the level of knowledge expected at the start of the Master's programme in Information Studies at the UvA. Details about the assignment can be found in the pdf present in this repository.

I personally decided to present the results a bit differently than the asked for in the assignment because I believe that DataFrames are better to visualize than the proposed hash table printout (*see pdf). Also, I added two more plots than required, involving the most common words per article and the most common words per article with more than 4 letters.

The construction of the text processor class can be found in the 'constructor.py' file, while the results analysis can be found in the 'analysis.ipynb' file.
